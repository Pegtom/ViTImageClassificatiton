# Modeling
I used Hugging Face library to train my dataset, I borrow ViTFeatureExtractor class from it. Here's the link: https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/model_doc/vit#:~:text=configuration%20%3D%20model.config-,ViTFeatureExtractor,-class%20transformers.

# Dataset
then I had to upload my dataset, I used kaggle dataset. If you need help to upload your dataset from kaggle,checkout this link:
  https://www.kaggle.com/general/74235.
  
  you can use the datasets which are already available in Huggin Face via this link: https://huggingface.co/datasets?task_categories=task_categories:image-classification
  
 # Results
 After I trained my dataset, I got 0.995 evaluation accuracy. I wanted to know which images decreased our acuracy; so I predicted the labels and foundout which was the problem
